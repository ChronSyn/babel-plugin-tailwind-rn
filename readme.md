# React Native Tailwind CSS

This is not production ready, is just a proof of concept currently.

# Installation

- `yarn add https://github.com/OwenMelbz/babel-plugin-tailwind-rn.git`

- `babel.config.js` add the plugin `tailwind-rn` e.g. `plugins: ['tailwind-rn']`

# Usage

We need to boot up the tailwind hook (until I figure out how to automate).

You do this by importing the hook into your entry file e.g. App.js

```js
import React from 'react';

// Add this!
import 'babel-plugin-tailwind-rn/dist/useTailwind'
```

Then use the normal react syntax!

```jsx
function App() {
	return <Text class="text-md lg:text-xl"></Text>
}
```

# Important Notes

## CSS Variables

Due to Tailwind 1.4 using CSS variables this messes up react native. This means we need to run Tailwind in IE11 mode.

You can do that by generating a config and setting the `target` to `ie11` e.g.

Generate the config with `npx tailwind init`

Set the target to ie11 e.g.

```js
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  target: 'ie11',
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
````

##Â Updating Config

If you make a change to the tailwind.config.js you will need to cancel your metro bundler and boot it up again
